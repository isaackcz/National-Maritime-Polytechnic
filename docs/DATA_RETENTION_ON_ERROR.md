# Data Retention on Error - Implementation Guide

## ✅ CRITICAL: ALL DATA RETAINED ON ERROR

### Overview
When form submission fails, **ALL user input must be retained** so they can fix errors and resubmit without losing their work.

---

## 🔒 HOW DATA RETENTION WORKS

### 1. State Management Strategy
**All form data is stored in React state:**
- Form fields → State variables
- Address dropdowns → State objects
- Date pickers → State variables
- File uploads → State variables

**On Error:**
- ❌ State is NOT cleared
- ❌ Data is NOT reset
- ❌ fetchPersonalInformation() is NOT called
- ✅ All state remains intact

---

### 2. Error Handling Implementation

#### ✅ CORRECT: Current Implementation
```javascript
try {
    // Submit form
    const response = await axios.post(...);
    
    // ONLY refresh on success
    if(response.status === 200 || response.status === 201) {
        alert('Success!');
        await fetchPersonalInformation(); // Refresh data
    }
} catch (error) {
    // Handle error - DO NOT refresh data
    alert('Error: Your data has been retained. Please try again.');
    
    // DO NOT call fetchPersonalInformation() here!
    // This keeps user's input intact
}
```

#### ❌ WRONG: What NOT to Do
```javascript
try {
    const response = await axios.post(...);
} catch (error) {
    // DON'T DO THIS - loses user's input!
    await fetchPersonalInformation(); // ❌ Resets to saved data
    
    // DON'T DO THIS - clears user's input!
    setFirstName(''); // ❌
    setAddressData({}); // ❌
}
```

---

## 📋 DATA RETENTION BY FIELD TYPE

### 1. Text Fields ✅
**How it works:**
- Value stored in state
- State NOT cleared on error
- User sees their exact input

**Example:**
```javascript
// State
const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');

// Input
<TextField 
    value={firstName}  // From state
    onChange={(e) => setFirstName(e.target.value)}
/>

// On error: firstName state unchanged ✅
```

---

### 2. Address Dropdowns ✅
**How it works:**
- All selections stored in addressData state object
- Component uses controlled state
- Dropdowns maintain selected values

**State Structure:**
```javascript
const [addressData, setAddressData] = useState({
    region: '',
    province: '',
    municipality: '',
    barangay: '',
    houseNo: '',
    postalCode: ''
});
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
<PhilippinesAddressDropdown 
    addressData={addressData}  // Pass current state
    setAddressData={setAddressData}  // Update state
/>
```

**On Error:**
- addressData state unchanged
- All dropdowns show selected values
- Cascade relationship maintained
- User doesn't need to re-select ✅

---

### 3. Date Fields ✅
**How it works:**
- Date stored as string in state
- Input shows selected date
- State NOT cleared on error

**Example:**
```javascript
// State
const [birthday, setBirthday] = useState('');

// Input
<TextField 
    type="date"
    value={birthday}  // From state
    onChange={(e) => setBirthday(e.target.value)}
/>

// On error: birthday state unchanged ✅
```

---

### 4. File Uploads ⚠️ SPECIAL CASE
**How it works:**
- File objects stored in state
- Files remain in state on error
- User doesn't need to re-upload

**State:**
```javascript
const [signatureFile, setSignatureFile] = useState(null);
const [IDPicture, setIDPicture] = useState(null);
```

**On Error:**
- File state variables remain populated
- Files will be included in next submit attempt
- User sees file is still selected ✅

**Note:** File input visual indication might reset (browser limitation), but file data is retained in state.

---

### 5. Select Dropdowns (Enum Fields) ✅
**How it works:**
- Selected value in state
- State NOT cleared on error

**Example:**
```javascript
// State
const [civilStatus, setCivilStatus] = useState('');

// Select
<TextField
    select
    value={civilStatus}  // From state
    onChange={(e) => setCivilStatus(e.target.value)}
>
    <MenuItem value="SINGLE">Single</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem value="MARRIED">Married</MenuItem>
</TextField>

// On error: civilStatus state unchanged ✅
```

---

### 6. Phone Number Fields ✅
**How it works:**
- PhoneInput component maintains value
- State NOT cleared on error

**Example:**
```javascript
// State
const [mobileNumber1, setMobileNumber1] = useState('');

// PhoneInput
<PhoneInput 
    value={mobileNumber1}  // From state
    onChange={setMobileNumber1}
/>

// On error: mobileNumber1 state unchanged ✅
```

## 🎯 ERROR SCENARIOS & DATA RETENTION

### Scenario 1: Validation Error (422)
**What happens:**
```javascript
// User submits form
Submit → Backend validates → Returns 422 error

// Frontend response:
alert('Validation Error: [error message]
Your data has been retained. Please fix the errors and submit again.');

// State: UNCHANGED ✅
// User sees: All their input still there
// Action: Fix error and resubmit
```

---

### Scenario 2: Network Error
**What happens:**
```javascript
// User submits form
Submit → Network fails → No response

// Frontend response:
alert('Cannot connect to server. Your data has been retained. 
Please check your internet connection and try again.');

// State: UNCHANGED ✅
// User sees: All their input still there
// Action: Check connection and retry
```

---

### Scenario 3: Server Error (500)
**What happens:**
```javascript
// User submits form
Submit → Server error → 500 response

// Frontend response:
alert('Session expired. Please login again.');
// OR
alert('Failed to save information. Please try again.');

// State: UNCHANGED ✅ (unless session expired)
// User sees: All their input still there (if not redirected)
```

---

### Scenario 4: Success
**What happens:**
```javascript
// User submits form
Submit → Backend saves → Returns 200/201

// Frontend response:
alert('Information saved successfully!');
await fetchPersonalInformation(); // Refresh with saved data

// State: UPDATED with fresh data from server ✅
// User sees: Saved data loaded from database
```

## 🔍 TESTING DATA RETENTION

### Test Case 1: Address Dropdown Retention
```
1. Select Region: "NCR"
2. Select Province: "Metro Manila"
3. Select Municipality: "Quezon City"
4. Select Barangay: "Bagong Lipunan"
5. Trigger error (disconnect internet)
6. Submit form
7. ✅ VERIFY: All dropdowns still show selections
8. ✅ VERIFY: Can still see full address
```

---

### Test Case 2: Multiple Field Retention
```
1. Fill all form fields (6 steps)
2. Upload all files
3. Trigger validation error (leave required field empty)
4. Submit form
5. ✅ VERIFY: All 6 steps retain data
6. ✅ VERIFY: Can navigate between steps
7. ✅ VERIFY: All data still visible
```

---

### Test Case 3: Date Field Retention
```
1. Select Birthday: "1990-01-01"
2. Select Disembarkation Date: "2023-12-31"
3. Trigger error
4. Submit form
5. ✅ VERIFY: Both dates still selected
6. ✅ VERIFY: Can see dates in input fields
```

---

### Test Case 4: File Upload Retention
```
1. Upload Signature file
2. Upload ID Picture file
3. Upload SRN file
4. Upload Sea Service file
5. Trigger error
6. Submit form
7. ⚠️ VERIFY: File objects still in state
8. ℹ️ NOTE: File input may appear empty (browser behavior)
9. ✅ VERIFY: Files will be sent on retry
```

---

## 💡 USER EXPERIENCE

### Good UX (Current Implementation)
```
User: *Fills 47 fields over 6 steps*
User: *Clicks Save*
System: "Validation Error: Email format is invalid. 
         Your data has been retained. Please fix the error."
User: *Fixes email*
User: *Clicks Save again*
System: "Success!"
User: 😊 Happy - didn't lose work
```

### Bad UX (What We're Avoiding)
```
User: *Fills 47 fields over 6 steps*
User: *Clicks Save*
System: "Error occurred"
System: *Resets all fields* ❌
User: *Has to fill everything again*
User: 😡 Frustrated - lost 10 minutes of work
```

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### 1. Session Expiry Exception
If error is 500 (session expired), user is redirected to login:
```javascript
if (error.response.status === 500) {
    alert('Session expired. Please login again.');
    removeToken('csrf-token');
    navigate('/access-denied'); // Redirect - data lost
}
```
**This is acceptable** - security takes precedence.

---

### 2. File Upload Visual Feedback
Browser file inputs reset their visual display after form submission attempts, but:
- ✅ File objects remain in state
- ✅ Files will be included in retry
- ℹ️ Input may appear empty (browser limitation)
- ✅ Files are still attached to form data

---

### 3. Navigation Between Steps
User can navigate between stepper steps even after error:
- ✅ Step 1 → Step 2: Data retained
- ✅ Step 2 → Step 1 → Step 2: Data still there
- ✅ All 6 steps maintain their data
